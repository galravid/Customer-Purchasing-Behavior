# Customer Purchasing Behavior Analysis

In this project, we built a structured dataset to analyze customer purchasing behavior.  
The preprocessing steps included:

- **Dataset creation**: Defined one continuous dependent variable (**y**) and nine independent variables (**xáµ¢**) including continuous, categorical, and binary features (at least one of each type).  
- **Handling missing values**: Removed rows containing missing data (as required for this assignment).  
- **Data transformation**: Converted textual values into numerical representations.  
- **Sampling**: Selected **10,000 records** using the `RAND` method in Excel to ensure a representative dataset.
